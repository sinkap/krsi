	  This enables instrumentation of the security hooks with
	  eBPF programs. The LSM creates per-hook files in securityfs to which
	  eBPF programs can be attached.

	help
	  eBPF programs attached to hooks can be used for both auditing and
	  enforcement. Enabling enforcement implies that the evaluation result
	  from the attached eBPF programs will allow or deny the operation
	  guarded by the security hook.
